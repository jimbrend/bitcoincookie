# Bitcoin Cookie 🍪⚡

**Bitcoin Cookie** is an open-source project aimed at bringing Bitcoin into the everyday through a simple, fun, and edible product: cookies!

The original idea is to collaborate with [@bullishbeef](https://x.com/bullishbeef) and leverage their awesome rewards tech at [checkout.tech](https://www.checkout.tech). While they and their partners already make great products, sourcing a high-quality white-label cookie partner has proven tricky myself — and I’m no baker myself.

So rather than gatekeep the process, I’d like to open source everything.
